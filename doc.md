Yes, you **can absolutely create a Windows-native project** that mimics some or all of the core functionality of `screen` â€” i.e., a **terminal multiplexer** that allows:

* Running multiple shell sessions in one terminal window
* Detaching and reattaching sessions
* Persistent background processes

However, implementing all `screen` features is a **complex systems-level project**, but you can definitely build a **simplified version**, especially by leveraging modern Windows APIs and PowerShell.

### âœ… Core Features You Could Implement

| Feature                   | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Session Management**    | Launch and track multiple shells (e.g., `cmd`, `powershell`, or `bash`). |
| **Session Persistence**   | Keep shell sessions alive even when terminal is closed.                  |
| **Detaching/Reattaching** | Let users detach from a session and reattach later.                      |
| **Named Sessions**        | Allow naming sessions like `screen -S mysession`.                        |
| **Basic UI**              | Optional: tabbed or split-pane UI to manage multiple sessions.           |

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack Options

#### ðŸ”¹ **Language Choices**

* **C# with .NET (WinForms / WPF / Terminal GUI)** â€“ great for system integration.
* **Python + subprocess + `pywin32`** â€“ fast prototyping.
* **Rust or C++** â€“ for performance-heavy or native app feel.
* **Electron + Node.js** â€“ if you prefer a cross-platform GUI.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Shell Handling**

* Use `Process` objects to launch `cmd`, `powershell`, or other shells.
* Redirect input/output to simulate terminal behavior.
* Store session state in files or in memory.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Detach/Reattach Strategy**

* Maintain a background process or service to hold active shell processes.
* Store session data (e.g., stdin/stdout buffers).
* Use a client CLI/GUI to connect to that background session.

### âœ… Starter Idea (Python Prototype)

```python
import subprocess
import os

sessions = {}

def create_session(name):
    p = subprocess.Popen("powershell", stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    sessions[name] = p
    print(f"Session '{name}' started with PID {p.pid}")

def list_sessions():
    for name in sessions:
        print(f"{name} -> PID {sessions[name].pid}")

create_session("test")
list_sessions()
```

This is obviously basic, but you can build from here:

* Add session save/load
* Wrap in GUI
* Implement detach via daemon or background service

### ðŸ§  Tip:

You donâ€™t need to replicate everything from `screen`. Start with a minimal set (launching, managing, and switching between shells), then evolve.
